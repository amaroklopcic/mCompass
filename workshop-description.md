mCompass adds a clean and minimalistic compass to the players HUD.

Features:
- Ability to modify compass width, height, x and y position on the screen, color, etc.
- 3 different styles taking inspiration from Fortnite, Squad, and PUBG
- A waypoint/spotting system (can be disabled)
- Server friendly (other settings in the script)

Current commands:
 - "mcompass_enabled" - Turns compass on and off. (0/1)
 - "mcompass_style" - Changes compass style; Can be seen in the image above. (1/2/3)
 - "mcompass_heading" - Enable or disable precise heading on the compass. (0/1)
 - "mcompass_xposition" - Change the compass X position. (0-1)
 - "mcompass_yposition" - Change the compass Y position. (0-1)
 - "mcompass_width" - Change the compass width. (0-1)
 - "mcompass_height" - Change the compass height. (0-1)
 - "mcompass_multiplier" - Change the spacing in between ticks/text. (1-10)
 - "mcompass_ratio" - Change the compass text and height ratio; Smaller value = bigger text. (0-10)
 - "mcompass_color" - Change the compass color. 
        - Command should be something like: "mcompass_color 255 255 255"
-"mcompass_spot (color)" - Adds in a marker for others to see.
        - Command should be something like: "mcompass_spot 255 255 255"
-"mcompass_reset" - Resets all settings back to default.

The plan is to remove the multiplier and ratio commands in a future version to simplify things. Standby for that.
